    <h3>Hacking</h3>
    <p><i>Hacking is the process of exploiting system vulnerabilities and compromising
security systems to gain unauthorized access to the system resources. 
It involves modifying system or application features to achieve a goal
outside of the creator’s original purpose</i></p></h4>
    <h3>Ethical Hacking</h3>
    <p><i>Ethical Hacking is the process to identify vulnerabilities to assure system security
by use of hacking tools, tricks, and techniques. It focuses on simulating methods used
by attackers to verify the existence of exploitable vulnerabilities in the system's security</i></p>
<h3>Hacker</h3>
<p><i>Hackers are intelligent individuals who spend enormous amounts of time
exploring computing resources like networks, websites, mobile devices, etc. to
identify critical vulnerabilities which can be used for exploitation. </i></p>
<h3>Ethical Hacker</h3>
<p><i>Ethical Hacker is an expert in computer internals and networking concepts, who
tries to find out potential vulnerabilities on the target systems before a hacker
could use, without actually doing any harm to the information systems on behalf
of the owners of the IT Assets</i></p>
<h3>Types of Hackers</h3>
<p><i><b>Black Hat (Crackers)</b>: Individuals utilize computing skills for malicious or destructive activities.<br>  
<b>White Hat</b>: Individuals utilizing hacking skills for the defensive purpose.<br>
<b>Gray Hat</b>: Individuals who work both offensively and defensively.<br>  
<b>Suicide Hackers</b>: Hackers who aim to shut down the critical infrastructure for
a cause and are not worried about facing punishment.<br>
<b>Script Kiddies</b>: An unskilled hacker who compromises the system by running
scripts, tools, and software developed by real hackers.

    <p><i>Ethical Hacker needs to think like malicious Hacker. Ethical hacking is necessary to defend
againist malicious hackers attempts, by anticipating methods they can use to break into a system. 
    ●	To fight against cyber crimes.<br>
    ●	To protect information from getting into wrong hands.<br> 
    ●	To build a defensive mechanism that avoids hackers from penetrating.<br>
    ●	To test the organization’s infrastructure security<br>
